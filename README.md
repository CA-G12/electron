## **About Our Website** <span id="about"></span>

This an electronics e-commerce shop that features products fetched from a database and allows you to add new products or delete existing products. 

The website was made with an enticing front-end design and a fully functional back-end programming. 

## **User Journey** :books: <span id="stories"></span>

The user enters the website to find a list of products. He then clicks on a product image and sees more details about the product and about the seller as well. 

If the user wanted to delete the product, he can do so by clicking the 'Delete Button' on the left corner of the screen. 

If the user wanted to add a new product, he can click on 'Add Product' on the top right corner of the screen. He'll see a pop up form that asks for details about the product. For the seller id, the user needs to enter a valid id that has been mentioned on the website before. 

That's how the user has full control of the database and the products list.
